# Batch Processing Enhancement - LSB Steganography Detector

## Overview

The LSB Steganography Detector has been enhanced with powerful batch processing capabilities that allow you to analyze entire folders of images and automatically identify high-risk images containing potential steganographic content.

## New Features

### üöÄ **Dual Analysis Modes**
- **Single Image Mode**: Analyze individual images with detailed results
- **Batch Folder Mode**: Process entire folders and focus on high-risk findings

### üìÅ **Folder Selection**
- Built-in folder picker using .NET MAUI Community Toolkit
- Windows-optimized folder selection dialog
- Support for analyzing hundreds of images in one batch

### üéØ **Smart Risk Classification**
- **High Risk**: Images with "Very High" or "High" steganography confidence
- **Medium Risk**: Images with moderate steganography indicators
- **Clean Images**: Images that passed all detection tests

### üìä **Dedicated Batch Results View**
- Real-time statistics during processing
- High-risk images displayed prominently
- Detailed breakdown of findings
- Interactive image details on tap

### ‚ö° **Real-time Progress Tracking**
- Live progress updates during batch processing
- Current file being processed
- Running count of high-risk images found
- Processing speed indicators

### üìÑ **Enhanced Reporting**
- Comprehensive batch analysis reports
- Exportable detailed findings
- Risk rate calculations
- Processing time metrics

## How to Use

### Step 1: Choose Analysis Mode
When you open the app, you'll see two options:
- **üñºÔ∏è Single Image**: For analyzing individual images
- **üìÅ Batch Folder**: For processing entire folders

### Step 2: Select Your Folder
1. Click "üìÅ Batch Folder"
2. Choose the folder containing images to analyze
3. The app will show you how many supported images were found

### Step 3: Start Batch Processing
1. Click "üöÄ Process Batch"
2. Watch real-time progress as images are analyzed
3. See high-risk count update in real-time

### Step 4: Review Results
The batch results page shows:
- **Statistics Panel**: Total images, high/medium/low risk counts
- **High-Risk Images List**: All flagged images with details
- **Processing Summary**: Time taken and efficiency metrics

### Step 5: Take Action
- **Tap any high-risk image** for detailed analysis
- **Export Full Report** for documentation
- **Process Another Folder** to continue analysis

## Technical Features

### Supported Image Formats
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg` - JPEG images
- `.png` - PNG images  
- `.bmp` - Bitmap images
- `.gif` - GIF images
- `.tiff`, `.tif` - TIFF images

### Detection Algorithms
The batch processor runs all five statistical tests:
1. **Chi-Square Test** - LSB randomness analysis
2. **Sample Pair Analysis** - Adjacent pixel correlation
3. **RS Analysis** - Block pattern irregularities  
4. **Entropy Analysis** - LSB plane randomness
5. **Histogram Analysis** - Pixel value distribution

### Performance Optimizations
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking UI during analysis
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time status updates
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing if individual images fail
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes images one at a time

## Risk Assessment Logic

### High Risk Classification
An image is flagged as **High Risk** if:
- Risk level is "Very High" OR "High"
- Multiple statistical tests show suspicious patterns
- Confidence level exceeds threshold values

### Benefits of Batch Mode
- **Efficiency**: Process hundreds of images automatically
- **Focus**: Only high-risk images require attention
- **Speed**: Much faster than individual analysis
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive reporting for forensic use

## Use Cases

### üîí **Security Analysis**
- Scan downloaded files for hidden content
- Analyze email attachments in bulk
- Check image uploads for steganographic content

### üîç **Digital Forensics**
- Process evidence folders efficiently
- Generate court-ready analysis reports
- Focus investigative time on suspicious files

### üõ°Ô∏è **Content Moderation**
- Batch analyze user-uploaded images
- Identify potential policy violations
- Automate preliminary screening

### üìö **Research & Training**
- Test detection algorithm effectiveness
- Create training datasets
- Validate steganography samples
