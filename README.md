## **🧪 How It Works - The Science**

Unlike deep learning approaches that fail with real LSB steganography (±1 pixel changes are too subtle), this app uses **proven statistical methods**:

### **1. Chi-Square Test** 📊
- **Purpose**: Tests if LSB distribution is truly random
- **How**: Compares observed vs expected frequency of 0s and 1s in LSB plane
- **Detects**: Non-random patterns typical of embedded messages
- **Threshold**: 3.84 (95% confidence level)

### **2. Sample Pair Analysis** 🔗
- **Purpose**: Detects correlations between adjacent pixels
- **How**: Analyzes LSB relationships in neighboring pixels
- **Detects**: Artificial correlations introduced by steganography
- **Threshold**: 0.1 deviation from expected 0.5 ratio

### **3. RS (Regular/Singular) Analysis** 📐
- **Purpose**: Examines block pattern irregularities
- **How**: Categorizes image blocks by variance characteristics
- **Detects**: Disruption of natural block patterns
- **Threshold**: 0.05 deviation in RS ratio

### **4. Entropy Analysis** 🌊
- **Purpose**: Measures randomness in LSB plane
- **How**: Calculates information entropy of LSB bits
- **Detects**: Unusually high entropy (too random for natural images)
- **Threshold**: 0.99 entropy level

### **5. Histogram Analysis** 📈
- **Purpose**: Identifies suspicious value distributions
- **How**: Analyzes even/odd pixel value pair ratios
- **Detects**: Artificial patterns in pixel value distribution
- **Threshold**: 0.02 suspicious pattern ratio

## **🧪 Test Cases & Validation**

### **Test with Clean Images**
```
Expected Result: ✅ NO STEGANOGRAPHY DETECTED
- All 5 tests should pass (show as NORMAL)
- Very Low to Low risk level
- Confidence < 40%
```

### **Test with LSB Steganography**
```
Expected Result: ⚠️ STEGANOGRAPHY DETECTED
- 2+ tests should fail (show as SUSPICIOUS)
- Medium to Very High risk level
- Confidence > 40%
```

### **Creating Test Images**
You can create test LSB steganography using tools like:
- **OpenStego** (Free, open-source)
- **Steghide** (Command-line tool)
- **Online LSB tools** (Various web-based tools)

---

## **📊 Understanding Results**

### **Risk Levels**
- **Very Low (0-20%)**: Clean image, no steganography
- **Low (20-40%)**: Possibly clean, minimal suspicion
- **Medium (40-60%)**: Moderate suspicion, investigate further
- **High (60-80%)**: Strong suspicion, likely steganography
- **Very High (80-100%)**: Almost certain steganography

### **Test Interpretations**

| Test Result | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Chi-Square: SUSPICIOUS** | LSB distribution is non-random |
| **Sample Pair: SUSPICIOUS** | Unusual pixel correlations detected |
| **RS Analysis: SUSPICIOUS** | Block patterns disrupted |
| **Entropy: SUSPICIOUS** | LSB plane too random for natural image |
| **Histogram: SUSPICIOUS** | Artificial pixel value patterns |

## **🚨 When NOT to Use This Tool**

This detector is specifically for **LSB steganography**. It will NOT detect:
- **Advanced steganography** (DCT-based, spread spectrum, etc.)
- **Encrypted/compressed hidden data** without LSB embedding
- **Non-steganographic modifications** (filters, compression artifacts)
- **Watermarks or metadata** (different detection methods needed)

---

## **🛠️ Customization**

### **Adjusting Detection Sensitivity**
Modify thresholds in `StatisticalLSBDetector.cs`:
```csharp
private const double CHI_SQUARE_THRESHOLD = 3.84;  // Lower = more sensitive
private const double SAMPLE_PAIR_THRESHOLD = 0.1;  // Lower = more sensitive
// ... etc
```

### **Adding New Tests**
1. Create new test method in `StatisticalLSBDetector.cs`
2. Add to test execution in `DetectLSBAsync`
3. Update UI to display new results

## **🎖️ Why This Works (vs Deep Learning)**

**Deep Learning Approach**: ❌ Failed with ~50% accuracy
- LSB changes too subtle (±1/255 = 0.004)
- Requires unrealistic training data
- Cannot detect real-world LSB steganography

**Statistical Approach**: ✅ Actually works
- Targets specific LSB artifacts
- Based on mathematical properties
- Proven in academic research
- Handles real steganography tools
