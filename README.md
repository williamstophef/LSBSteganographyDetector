## **🧪 How It Works - The Science**

Unlike deep learning approaches that fail with real LSB steganography (±1 pixel changes are too subtle), this app uses **proven statistical methods**:

### **1. Chi-Square Test** 📊
- **Purpose**: Tests if LSB distribution is truly random
- **How**: Compares observed vs expected frequency of 0s and 1s in LSB plane
- **Detects**: Non-random patterns typical of embedded messages
- **Threshold**: 9.0 (enhanced conservative threshold)

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
χ² = Σ((Oᵢ - Eᵢ)² / Eᵢ)

Where:
- Oᵢ = Observed frequency of LSB value i (0 or 1)
- Eᵢ = Expected frequency = total_samples / 2
- LSB extracted from R, G, B channels of each pixel
- H₀: LSBs are randomly distributed
- H₁: LSBs show non-random patterns (steganography)
```

### **2. Sample Pair Analysis** 🔗
- **Purpose**: Detects correlations between adjacent pixels
- **How**: Analyzes LSB relationships in neighboring pixels
- **Detects**: Artificial correlations introduced by steganography
- **Threshold**: 0.25 deviation from expected 0.5 ratio

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
Deviation = |SP_ratio - 0.5|

Where:
- SP_ratio = same_pairs / total_pairs
- same_pairs = count of adjacent pixels with identical LSBs
- total_pairs = total adjacent pixel pairs analyzed
- Natural images: SP_ratio ≈ 0.5 (random distribution)
- Steganography: SP_ratio deviates significantly from 0.5
```

### **3. RS (Regular/Singular) Analysis** 📐
- **Purpose**: Examines block pattern irregularities
- **How**: Categorizes image blocks by variance characteristics
- **Detects**: Disruption of natural block patterns
- **Threshold**: 0.02 deviation in RS ratio

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
RS_deviation = |(R - S) / T|

Where:
- R = Regular blocks (variance < 10)
- S = Singular blocks (variance > 100)
- T = Total blocks analyzed
- Block size = 4×4 pixels
- Variance = Σ(xᵢ - μ)² / n

Block Classification:
- Regular: Low variance (smooth regions)
- Singular: High variance (textured regions)
- Steganography disrupts natural R/S balance
```

### **4. Entropy Analysis** 🌊
- **Purpose**: Measures randomness in LSB plane
- **How**: Calculates information entropy of LSB bits
- **Detects**: Unusually high entropy (too random for natural images)
- **Threshold**: 0.997 entropy level

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
H(X) = -Σ p(xᵢ) × log₂(p(xᵢ))

Where:
- X = LSB sequence from R, G, B channels
- p(xᵢ) = probability of LSB value xᵢ (0 or 1)
- H(X) ∈ [0, 1] for binary data
- Natural images: H(X) < 0.997
- Perfect steganography: H(X) → 1.0 (maximum entropy)
```

### **5. Histogram Analysis** 📈
- **Purpose**: Identifies suspicious value distributions
- **How**: Analyzes even/odd pixel value pair ratios
- **Detects**: Artificial patterns in pixel value distribution
- **Threshold**: 0.1 suspicious pattern ratio

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
Suspicious_ratio = Suspicious_patterns / 128

For each even/odd pair (i, i+1) where i ∈ [0, 254]:
- Ratio = |count(i) / (count(i) + count(i+1)) - 0.5|
- If Ratio > 0.3: increment Suspicious_patterns

Where:
- count(i) = frequency of pixel value i in histogram
- 128 = total even/odd pairs analyzed
- Natural images: even/odd ratios ≈ 0.5
- LSB embedding creates asymmetric distributions
```

### **6. Python LSB Pattern Detection** 🐍
- **Purpose**: Detects Python-style LSB embedding patterns
- **How**: Analyzes cross-channel correlation and repetition
- **Detects**: Python tools that embed identical data in R, G, B channels
- **Threshold**: 0.30 combined score

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
Combined_score = (Correlation × 0.6) + (Repetition × 0.4)

Channel Correlation:
Correlation = matches / total_comparisons
Where matches = count(LSB_R[i] = LSB_G[i] = LSB_B[i])

Pattern Repetition:
Repetition = max(pattern_matches / pattern_checks)
For pattern lengths: 64-120 bits (8-15 characters)

Python Indicators:
- High correlation across R, G, B channels
- Repeating message patterns
- Sequential LSB extraction order
```

### **Overall Detection Algorithm** ⚖️

The final detection uses a **weighted scoring system** to combine all test results:

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
Overall_Confidence = Σ(Weight_i × Test_i) / Σ(Weight_i)

Test Weights (optimized for accuracy):
- Chi-Square Test: 3.5    (most reliable indicator)
- Python LSB Pattern: 2.0 (highly specific)
- RS Analysis: 1.0        (moderately reliable)
- Sample Pair: 0.6        (prone to texture noise)
- Entropy: 0.4            (often misleading)
- Histogram: 0.3          (high false positive rate)

Detection Criteria:
- High Entropy (≥0.996) + 2+ suspicious tests → DETECTED
- Python Pattern + High Entropy → DETECTED  
- PNG files: 4+ tests suspicious + confidence >80%
- JPEG files: 4+ tests suspicious + confidence >85%
- Other formats: 3+ tests suspicious + confidence >75%
```

private const double SAMPLE_PAIR_THRESHOLD = 0.25; // Lower = more sensitive  
private const double RS_THRESHOLD = 0.02;          // Lower = more sensitive
private const double ENTROPY_THRESHOLD = 0.997;    // Lower = more sensitive
private const double HISTOGRAM_THRESHOLD = 0.1;    // Lower = more sensitive
private const double PYTHON_LSB_THRESHOLD = 0.30;  // Lower = more sensitive
```
